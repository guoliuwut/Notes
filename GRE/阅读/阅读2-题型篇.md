分题型讨论为的是清楚的认识GRE阅读中的出题方式, 如此才能在考试中忘记这些分类, 而去更好的分析判断选项.

GRE文章宏观的可以分为两类:

* presentation 一个人在讲他的某个观点 (可能包含好几面)
* argumentation 有两个乃至多个观点

##1-取非题
**模式:** [A, A AGN B, B = ?]
A 与 B 对比关系, 已知A的特点, 问B的特点: 对A取反

> [例] Unlike song sparrows, the warbler continuously composes much longer and more variable songs without repetition.
>
> According to the passage, the song sparrow
> (A). uses songs mainly in territorial behavior
> (B). continuously composes long and complex songs
> (C). has a much larger song repertoire
> **(D). repeats one song type before switching to another**
> (E). responds aggressively to recorded songs

##2-改善题
**模式:** 题干: 虚拟 + 改善
特点: 虚拟语气, 如 if true ... 
正确答案: 文章中没有说过的点, 假想的情况; 即找到**缺陷和不足(负评价词)**然后进行改善.

> [例] As a member of the middle class, Gaskell could hardly help approaching working-class life as an outside observer and a reporter, and the reader of the novel is always conscious of this.
>
> It can be inferred that the author of the passage believes that the novel might have been even better if Gaskell had
> (A). concentrated on the emotions of a single character
> (B). made no attempt to re-create experiences of which she had no first-hand knowledge
> (C). made no attempt to reproduce working class dialects
> (D). grown up in an industry city
> (E). managed to transcend her position as an outsider
>
> 缺陷在于 outside... 即虽然想要接近中产阶级, 但是只是一个旁观者
> 那么答案就明显是E


##3-陪衬题
**模式:** 主体, 客体
主体A: 通篇描述的对象
客体B: 为了表现A而出现B来进行衬托
主体客体逻辑关系: **因果, 相反, 相似**
正确选项: ==一定要把B和A联系在一起==

> [例] ==Some recent historians== have argued that life in the British colonies in America from approximately 1763 to 1789 was marked by internal conflicts among colonists.
> ==Inheritors== of some of the viewpoints of early twentieth-century Progressive historians such as Beard and Becker, ==these recent historians== have put forward arguments that deserve evaluation.
>
> The author most likely refers to ‚historians such as Beard and Becker‛ in order to
> (A). isolate the two historians whose work is most representative of the viewpoints of Progressive historians
> (B). emphasize the need to find connections between recent historical writing and the work of earlier historians
> (C). make a case for the importance of the views of the Progressive historians concerning eighteenth-century American life
> (D). suggest that Progressive historians were the first to discover the particular internal conflicts in eighteenth-century American life mentioned in the passage
> (E). point out historians whose views of history anticipated some of the views of the recent historians mentioned in the passage
>
> E中的anticipate 「促进」体现了文中的因果关系(inheritors of B&B = recent historians)

##4-举例作用题
**模式:** 在例子前方找答案 (必然是先提出观点, 然后用例子证明)
不要回去重新读这个例子! 例子中本身是没有答案的!

> [例] Over the years, biologists have suggested two main pathways by which sexual selection may have shaped the evolution of male birdsong. In the first, male competition and intra-sexual selection produce relatively short, simple songs used mainly in territorial behavior. _In the second, female choice and inter-sexual selection produce longer, more complicated songs used mainly in mate attraction_; **like** such visual ornamentation as the pecock’s tail, elaborate vocal characteristics increase the male’s chances of being chosen as a mate.
>
> The author mentions the peacock’s tail most probably in order to
> (A). cite an explanation to the theory of the relationship between male competition and intra-sexual selection.
> (B). illustrate the importance of both the pathways that shaped the evolution of birdsong.
> (C). draw a distinction between competing theories of inter-sexual selection
> **(D). give an example of a feature that may have evolved through inter-sexual selection by female choice**
> (E). refute a commonly held assumption about the role of song in mate attraction

##5-排除题

> **[例2]** Afro-American poetry owes its early forms, rhythms, vocabulary, and evangelical fervor to Wesleyan hymnals.
>
> All of the following aspects of Afro-American poetry are referred to in the passage as having been influenced by Wesleyan hymnals EXCEPT
> **(A). subject matter**   (B). word choice   (C). rhythm   (D). structure   (E). religious tone
>
> 涉及同义词变换; 

##6-支持题
**模式1:** [if true + support / strength / demonstrate / illustrate...]
**正确选项**: 复述 + 细节 
比如: 文章中说所有的动物都...; 在选项中就要进行具体化, 比如某种具体动物的名字. **用一种更具体的方式, 重复文中的观点**.

> [例1] Innovative as it is, the acto owes much to the theater traditions of other periods and regions.
> 背景: acto 美国农民戏剧
>
> Which one of the following, if true, most strengthen the author’s argument concerning the debt of the acto to the theater traditions of other periods and regions?
> (A). Many popular forms of theater rely heavily on improvisation.
> (B). Plays resembling the acto in structure were written in the 1970s by West American playwrights who were interested in dramatizing the richness of their own cultures.
> (C). The use of mask has, at one time or another, been characteristic of the theater traditions of almost all cultures, even those most isolated from outside influences.

**正确选项:** 脑补中间一环, 使A能够顺利推导出C

> [例2] In the past ten years, there have been several improvements in mountain-climbing equipment. These improvements have made the sport both safer and more enjoyable for experienced climbers. Despite these improvements, however, the rate of mountain-climbing injuries has doubled in past ten years.
>
> Which of the following, if true, best reconciles the apparent discrepancy presented in the passage?
> **(A). Many climbers, lulled into a false sense of security, use the new equipment to attempt climbing feats of which they are not capable.**
> (B). Some mountain-climbing injuries are caused by unforeseeable weather conditions.
> (C). Mountain climbing, although a dangerous sport, does not normally result in injury to the experienced climber.
> (D). In the past ten years there have been improvements in mountain-climbing techniques as well as in mountain-climbing equipment.
> (E). Although the rate of mountain-climbing injuries has increased, the rate of mountain-climbing deaths has not changed.

**模式3:** ?---B---C
**正确选项:** 脑补出前提条件

> [例3] Over a period of several months, researchers attached small lights to the backs of wetas—flightless insects native to New Zealand-enabling researchers for the first time to make comprehensive observations of the insects' nighttime activities.
> Thus, since wetas forage only at night, the researchers' observations will significantly improve knowledge of the normal foraging habits of wetas.
>
> Which of the following is an assumption on which the argument depend？
> (A). Researchers were interested only in observing the wetas' foraging habits and so did not keep track of other types of behavior.
> (B). No pattern of behavior that is exhibited by wetas during the nighttime is also exhibited by wetas during the daytime.
> **(C). Attaching the small lights to the wetas' backs did not greatly alter the wetas' normal night-time foraging habits.**
> (D). Wetas typically forage more frequently during the months in which the researchers studied them than they do at other times.
> (E). The researchers did not use other observational techniques to supplement their method of using small lights to track the nighttime behavior of wetas.

##7-反对题

##11-不定项选择题
**模式:** For the following question, consider each of the choices separately and select all that apply.

这两种题型没有特别好的针对方法, 排除法是比较合适的:
3+1+1 3个经典错误选项, 一个干扰选项 --> 使用正确的排除方法

==如何才能打造出一个不容置疑的经典错误选项？==

1. **无**中生有 (文中没有的**关键词**)
    
    在长长的选项中藏一个没出现过的概念.
    
2. **无**中生有(文中没有的**逻辑关系**)

    文章讲A和B没关系, 选项中编出个A和B的逻辑关系(因果, 相似, 对比), 比如偷偷藏一个influence.

3. 以**偏**概全

    A包括B和C --> A只包含C

4. **夸**大其词

    不错的作家 --> 顶级作家

    remove sth --> eliminate sth 彻底清除

5. 预**卜**未来

    选项中贸然说**未来一定**会怎么样, 肯定是错的.
##12-句子/段落功能题
全凭个人阅读能力!

> [例] At a certain period in Earth’s history, its atmosphere contained almost no oxygen, although plants were producing vast quantities of oxygen. As a way of reconciling these two facts, scientists have hypothesized that nearly all of the oxygen being produced was taken up by iron on Earth’s surface. Clearly, however, **this explanation is inadequate. New studies show that the amount of iron on Earth’s surface was not sufficient to absorb anywhere near as much oxygen as was being produced**. Therefore, something in addition to the iron on Earth’s surface must have absorbed much of the oxygen produced by plant life. In the argument given, the two portions in boldface play which of the following roles?
> (A). The first is a claim made by the argument in support of a certain position; the second is that position.
> (B). The first is a judgment made by the argument about a certain explanation; the second is that explanation.
> (C). The first expresses the argument’s dismissal of an objection to the position it seeks to establish; the second is that position.
> **(D). The first sums up the argument’s position with regard to a certain hypothesis; the second provides grounds for that position.**
> (E). The first sums up the argument’s position with regard to a certain hypothesis; the second provides grounds for that position.
>
> 第二句话是第一句话的原因. 
> D 中 ground 暗示了因果关系

##13-词汇题

> (C). unrealistic
> (D). novel
> (E). paradoxical
