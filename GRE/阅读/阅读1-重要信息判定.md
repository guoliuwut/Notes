[TOC]

在阅读中对不同的内容读的时候要详略得当, 具体方法可以分为三个部分:

* 重要信息判定 (读的过程中要分清主次)
* 非匀速 (过渡类信息略读; 与题目相关的信息详读)
* 阅读笔记

对于上面三个步骤, 最关键的就是考点的判断(==逻辑体现==)! 主要可以针对下面这些.

##考点1-因果关系
1. **because, for, since**

2. **V + from** (表示“来自于”的短语) 
    
    originate; stem; spring; emanate; derive;
    
3. **motivate, stimulate, spur, inspire** (表示: 引起, 引发 之类的动词)

4. **influence, :/;, reflection, extension** 
    A影响了B; 那么A就是原因 
    冒号, 分号: 引导因果关系, 后面的是原因 
    A is B's reflection. B是原因 
    A is B's extension. B是原因    

>**[例1]** **Because** the _number of eggs_ a female moth produces is directly related to her _size_, and **because** her size is determined entirely by her _feeding success_ as a caterpillar, the trees’ defensive mechanism has an impact on moth fecundity.
>笔记:
>number of eggs <-- size <-- feeding success
>看到提示元素, 明确因果关系对象

>
>**[例2]** If from the outset Black people were _discriminated_ against, then legal slavery should be viewed as a **reflection** and an **extension** of _racial prejudice_.
>笔记:
>if dis, rac pre --> leg sla


##考点2-对比关系 (A AGN B)
1. **unlike, contrast, however, but**
2. **比较级**
3. **时间状语** (时间分界点可能暗示今昔对比)    
    1950年之前, 女性就业很受局限. --> 题: 1950年后女性就业状态? 不受局限
    
> **[例1]** _African music_, **unlike** the music of some _other cultures_, was based on a total vision of life, in which music was not an isolated social domain.
> 笔记:
> A AGN other
> A: based on a total vis, not isolated
> 分析: other music的状态就应该对A取反

>**[例2]** **In the early 1950s**, historians who studied preindustrial Europe began for the first time in large numbers, to investigate more of the preindustrial European _population_ than the 2 or 3 percent who comprised the political and social _elite_.
>笔记
>e 1950s: pop, X elite
>问 pre-1950s ? 研究更多的是elite

##考点3-相似关系 (A/B)
1. **similar, like, parallel** 
2. **remind**
    A reminds us of B. 暗示了A和B之间是类似关系.

> **[例1]** By taking pictures, _they_ are getting away from the pretensions of art as exemplified by painting **remind** us of those _Abstract Expressionist_ painters who imagined they were getting away from the intellectual austerity of classical Modernist painting by concentrating on the physical act of painting.
> 笔记:
> they / A.E.
> they: get away from, pre of art (摆脱艺术中的矫揉造作)
> A.E.: get away from, austerity of cl.M painting (摆脱条条框框)

##考点4-三种字符
1. **大写字母** (人名/地名)
2. **数字**
3. **引号**
    引用(某人说的话) --- 态度题 
    讽刺 --- 态度题, 批判, 不认可
    强调 --- 信息题

##考点5-让步与转折
1. **although, though**
2. **yet, but, however**
3. **in fact, actually** (其实)
4. **unfortunately, surprisingly, ironically, paradoxically(似非而是的)**

##考点6-数量关系 (>, <, ↑, ↓)

比较简单, 直观判断就是


##考点7-重要性提示词
这些词非常重要, 特别容易设置考点!

1. **most, first, last, never...** (表示极限的词) 
    如: 当年的作家中, 他是最多产的. 题: 他当年的特点是什么?
2. **complete, total, absolute, entire** (表示完全的, 彻底的)
3. **unlimited, unrestricted, un-confined, un-stinted, un-sircumscribed, unmitigated, unqualified** (un+Ved 表示没有限制的..)
4. **only, sole, unique, exclusive** (表示唯一的词)
5. **比较级**

> **[例1]** In the periods of _peak_ zooplankton abundance, that is, in the late spring and summer, Haney recorded _maximum_ daily community grazing rates.
> 笔记: 
> *z, (late spr + sum), H max grazing

**注意:**
如果和文章中内容无法对应的话, 选项中出现这样的词, 往往是错误的;
如: 不错的 --> most successful

##考点8-评价
对于正负评价的词, 做笔记的时候要记下来!

1. **(+)** (正评价)
2. **(-)** (负评价)
3. **neither (+) nor (-)** (不好不坏, 在GRE中==不会有这样的态度==!!!)
4. **m(+), m(-)** (有优点也有缺点, 主正 或 主负)

    **注意:** 
    经典错误选项:
    indifferent 在态度上表示不置可否的

##实例分析

**GRE Reading: *Brown Girl*, Brownstones**
> Paule Marshall's Brown Girl, Brownstones (1959) was a landmark in the depiction of female characters in Black American literature.
> Marshall avoided the oppressed and tragic heroine in conflict with White society that had been typical of the protest novels of early twentieth century.
> **PM, "B" (+)**
> **PM, X opp, tra, W, (typi, protest nov, e 20th cen)**
> Like her immediate predecessors, Zora Neale Hurston and Gwendolyn Brooks, she focused her novel on an ordinary Black woman's search for identity within the context of a Black community.
> **PM // ZNH, GB (B, B)**
> But Marshall extended the analysis of Black female characters begun by Hurston and Brooks by depicting her heroine's development in terms of the relationship between her Barbadian American parents, and by exploring how male and female roles were defined by their immigrant culture, which in turn was influenced by the materialism of White America.
> **PM ext H, B : heroi, relation, parents; roles, definey by imm** 
> **imm ← materialism W**
> By placing characters within a wider cultural context, Marshall attacked racial and sexual stereotypes and paved the way for explorations of race, class, and gender in the novels of the 1970's.
> **wider, PM X stereo (racial, sex)**
> **pave: explo 1970**

**GRE Reading: Lliad vs. Odyssey**
> Of Homer’s two epic poems, the *Odyssey* has always been more popular than the *Iliad*, perhaps because it includes more features of mythology that are accessible to readers.
> **[ O > I, ← myth, reader]**
> Its subject (to use Maynard Mack’s categories) is “life-as-spectacle,” for readers, diverted by its various incidents, observe its hero Odysseus primarily from without; the tragic Iliad, however, presents “life-as-experience”: readers are asked to identify with the mind of Achilles, whose motivations render him a not particularly likable hero.
> **O AGN I**
> **(O: spe, div, vari,        without**
> **I: exp, asked to id      mind A, moti, not likable)**
> In addition, the Iliad, more than the Odyssey, suggests the complexity of the gods’ involvement in human actions, and to the extent that modern readers find this complexity a needless complication, the Iliad is less satisfying than the Odyssey, with its simpler scheme of divine justice.
> **I: human,                   complex, (-) (-)**
> **O: divine                    simple**
> Finally, since the Iliad presents a historically verifiable action, Troy’s siege, the poem raises historical questions that are absent from the Odyssey’s blithely imaginative world.
> **I: his, T, questions**
> **O: imagine, blithely**
