## Barron 1~20

**[题2 单选]** In Europe, where wine has been part of daily life for thousands of years, American wine-lovers are sometimes viewed as \_\_\_\_\_—zealous and somewhat narrow-minded converts to a generous and pantheistic faith.

A. artisans
B. hypocrites
C. monomaniacs
D. reprobates
E. surrogates

> 逻辑判断: 
>
> converts 表示前后信仰的变化, 应当对`generous and pantheistic faith` 「慷慨而广泛的信仰」取反;
>
> 也可以根据「破折号」表示解释对`zealous and somewhat narrow-minded` 取同
>
> 故而选 monomaniacs偏执, 狂热的人
>
> 句子梳理: 在欧洲, 千百年来酒已经变成日常生活的一部分, 美国的饮酒爱好者通常被视为狂热者转变为一种慷慨而广泛的信仰.
>

**[题4 双选]** Rather than allowing these dramatic exchanges between her characters to develop fully, Ms. Norman unfortunately tends to \_\_\_\_\_ the discussions involving two women.

A. exacerbate
B. curtail
C. protract
D. augment
E. truncate
F. elaborate

> 逻辑判断: Rather than表示前后取反
>
> 上句可知，作者并不想develop fully，即让人物变得更丰满，所以not allow exchanges between characters，
> 下句重复，two women=characters， not allow exchanges=curtail/truncate the discussion.
> 全文大概意思是，作者并不想再多谈论这两个角色之间的变化来让人物变得丰满，作者倾向于删减这两个角色之间的讨论.

**[题8 双选]** Far from viewing consumption as a romantic, even glamorous disease, an affliction of emotionally enhanced or refined beings, Sontag, steadfastly refusing to idealize the disease, observed that the \_\_\_\_\_ attaching to consumption eventually diminished as science clarified the cause of the illness, and as treatment became first possible and then routine.

A. distinction
B. cachet
C. therapy
D. idiosyncrasy
E. relevance
F. duties

> 逻辑判断: far from表示前后转折, 态度相反
>
> 这里consumption表示一种病「肺痨」不需要知道
>
> 前半句, 这种病被美化, 视作浪漫, 有魅力的
>
> Sontag拒绝美化这种病, 在澄清其起因之后, 「空格」部分表示这种病的属性被消除. 
>
> 空格部分逻辑不需要取反, 因为far from表示的是两种态度的对立. 故而前后对应, 选distinction 荣誉/cachet 声望

**[题9 双选]** In giving advice to his son, old Polonius expressed himself only in \_\_\_\_\_; every bit of counsel he gave was a truism.

A. chestnuts
B. platitudes
C. suppositions
D. encomiums
E. conundrums
F. epithets

> 逻辑分析: 没有反义, 前后逻辑一致. 空格对应truism 陈词滥调, 故而选chestnuts/ platitudes
>
> 错误原因: 单词不认识

**[题10 双选]** Despite her autocratic father's efforts to maintain his control over her, Elizabeth Barrett, concealing a rebellious spirit behind \_\_\_\_\_ exterior, played obedient daughter and successfully managed to elope with her fellow poet, Robert Browning.

A. an irascible
B. a dutiful
C. a complaisant
D. an aesthetic
E. a defiant
F. a despotic

> 逻辑分析: despite表示分句前后逻辑相反
>
> 空格: 内部逻辑相同, \_\_\_\_\_\_ exterior 与 played obedient daughter对应, 且逻辑一致, 故而选complaisant/dutiful
>
> 错误原因: 把defiant认错了

==**[题5 双选]**== Refusing to let the enemy see how deeply shaken he was by his capture, the prisoner kept his face \_\_\_\_\_.

A. caustic
B. immaculate
C. scrupulous
D. impassive
E. blank
F. pedantic

> 逻辑分析: 没有反义, 有一个否定refusing to, 前后逻辑取反
>
> 前半句 **he** = the prisoner, enemy = his capture
>
> 因为不想被敌人看到他的恐惧(shake), 故意表现的面无表情/冷漠DE
>
> 问题: 句子分析有些问题

==**[题18 双选]**== A \_\_\_\_\_ of errors led to a major malfunction in the operating system.

A. condemnation
B. concatenation
C. paucity
D. chain
E. cancellation
F. taxonomy

> 这个题目做对很容易, 但是我觉得还是挺有迷惑性的. 
>
> 如果选项中有一个和paucity相近的词, 如speck, 很有可能就会选.
> 一些小错误导致了操作系统的重大错误.
>
> 但是实际上还是错误的, 句子中没有表示逻辑相反或是否定的提示, 属于不必然选项. (自己带入背景知识)
>
> 正确选项: 一连串的 concatenation/ chain

==**[题20 双选]**== Written in epistolary form, and therefore strikingly unlike her earlier novels, Jane Austen‘s incomplete novel *Lady Susan* nonetheless \_\_\_\_\_ several dramatic themes evident in those youthful works.

A. criticizes
B. reiterates
C. invalidates
D. conceals
E. echoes
F. terminates

> 逻辑分析: unlike her earlier novels 表示相反,  nonetheless 转折, 逻辑上空格表示同义
>
> 语义分析: earlier novels = youthful works, 前面说form格式上完全不同, 主题上还是重复 , 所以应该选 reiterate/ echo 重复
>
> 问题: 句义理解有些问题



## Barron 21~40

**[题2 双选]** In a sense, Constable‘s art and politics were shaped by one dominant emotion: an abiding, even obsessive \_\_\_\_\_ the world of his rural childhood, the only world in which he probably felt at ease.

A. divergence from
B. attachment to
C. regard for
D. ignorance of
E. facility with
F. indifference to

> 逻辑判断: 冒号表示同义, 后面都是在对emotion进行解释
>
> 空格判断: 根据最后一部分那么他对the world的态度应当是正面的
>
> attachment 喜爱, regard for 尊重, 敬爱 
>
> 问题: 对even的判断有误, 这里表示递进, 情感上更进一步abiding 持久的 —>obsessive 着迷的
>
> 这里even obsessive设置就是干扰, 去掉也不影响

==**[题5 双空]**== Surprisingly, to those who view the ocean floor as a uniformly (i)\_\_\_\_\_ waste, each vent in the floor, where the sea water is heated by the earth's interior magma, has been found to be an island-like (ii) \_\_\_\_\_ with its own distinctive fauna.

Blank(i)

sunken
hazardous
barren

Blank(ii)

oasis
enclave
grotto

> 逻辑判断: 第一空对应waste，waste表示荒芜的意思，选barren; surprisingly 取反，第二空与荒芜取反，就是绿洲了
>
> 很容易误选sunken 沉没的, 但是文中没有提这个!

**[题10 双空]** Because the vast majority of Cambodia's population is made up of members of a single ethnic group, the Khmer, the country possesses a (i) \_\_\_\_\_ unique in Southeast Asia that has (ii) \_\_\_\_\_ a strong sense of national identity.

Blank(i)

sophisticaiton
heterodoxy
homogeneity

Bland(ii)

encouraged
abandoned
exacerbated

> 逻辑判断: 没有反义没有否定, 所以是同义重复
>
> 第一空: country拥有在SA都是独特的东西, 根据前句判断选homogeneity 同质
>
> 第二空: 因为同质, 所以增强国家认可, encouraged
>
> 问题: 判断第一空的时候把heterodoxy 异端邪说, 自己延伸成了「独特」的含义! 这个词是负面词! 另一方面第一空不是修饰unique, 而是counter的宾语!

**[题12 双空]** Although he did not consider himself (i)\_\_\_\_\_, he felt that the inconsistencies in her story (ii)\_\_\_\_\_ a certain degree of incredulity on his part.

Blank(i)

an apostate
a charlatan
a skeptic

Blank(ii)

demonstrated
dignified
warranted

> 逻辑判断: Although表示转折, not否定, 前后同义重复
>
> 第二空: 因为her story 前后矛盾(inconsistencies), 第二空可以填入warrant「批准; 保证; 使显得必要justify) ; demonstrate表示因果关系, 在这里没有必然的因果关系(这一空改的不是很好!)
>
> 第一空: 后面说incredulity on his part, 表示关于他的部分不可信, 那么由于前后同义重复, 说明可以填入表示怀疑的词, a skeptic 怀疑论者
>
> 问题: 在看题的时候对人物指代处理很混乱

**[题13 双空]** The auctioneer prided himself on his imperturbability under the most hectic of circumstances; no matter how (i)\_\_\_\_\_ the bidding became or how immensely precious the items he auctioned, he allowed nothing to (ii)\_\_\_\_\_ his composure.

Blank(i)

frenzied
magnanimous
sporadic

Blank(ii)

ameliorate
unsettle
denigrate

> 逻辑判断: 没有反义, 表示句子同义
>
> 第一空: or 并列, 前后同义重复选一个和immensely 巨大的相近的词, frenzied 形容bidding出价 可以
>
> 第二空: 前面形容他是imperturbalibity冷静, 不受干扰, 这里对应的unsettle打搅, 干扰正合适(前面有个否定, 所以取反). denigrate表示玷污, 不合适

**[题17 三空]** The two executives were a study in contrasts: where the chief financial officer was (i)\_\_\_\_\_ keeping accurate records and famous within the company for her (ii)\_\_\_\_\_, the chief executive officer was far more liberal in his spending habits and not particularly known for (iii)\_\_\_\_\_ recordkeeping.

Blank(i)

overwhelmed by
meticulous about
restricted to

Blank(ii)

economy
meekness
eccentricity

Blank(iii)

intuitive
scrupulous
manifest

> 问题: 主要是第一空restricted误认为了严格的, 实际是「受限制的」

**[题18 双空]** Credit is (i)\_\_\_\_\_, and hard for even one person to hold onto, but (ii)\_\_\_\_\_, sticky as honey, goes everywhere and sticks to everyone.

Blank(i)

bankrupt
marginal
slippery

Blank(ii)

blame
misfortune
sweetness

> 问题: 单词认知错误, credit 「称赞」第二空找credit反义, blame「责备」合适 creditable 值得称赞的, 该想到的!

**[题19 双空]** By holding the balance of power in the sparsely settled borderlands between English and French settlements, and by their (i)\_\_\_\_\_ to use their power against one or the other nation if not appropriately treated, the Iroquois played the game of European power politics with (ii)\_\_\_\_\_.

Blank(i)

hesitancy
willingness
incapacity

Blank(ii)

partiality
diversity
effectiveness

> It is easier to answer this question if you tackle the second blank first. If the Iroquois were holding the balance of power between the English and the French in the borderlands, then they were doing well in playing the
> game of European power politics. In fact, they were playing it with effectiveness. And what made them so effective was their willingness to use their power if they were not treated well.
> **Hesitancy** is incorrect. They would not have done well at the game of power politics if they had shown any hesitancy (reluctance) about using their power.
> **Incapacity** is incorrect. They would not have done well at the game of power politics if they had shown any incapacity (inability) to use their power.
> **Partiality** is incorrect. The Iroquois felt free to use their power "against one or the other nation." They showed no partiality (bias or favoritism) in playing one side against the other.

**[题20 三空]** Raphael created works that were avidly sought by the most powerful and discriminating secular and ecclesiastical princes of his day. Some favored patrons he readily (i)\_\_\_\_\_; others, like the demanding Isabella d\`Este, the overtaxed artist (ii)\_\_\_\_\_ with polite but (iii)\_\_\_\_\_ promises.

Blank(i)

encountered
distrusted
obliged

Blank(ii)

strung along
told off
came across

Blank(iii)

sincere
pointed
idle

> 问题: 单词和词组认知错误
>
> obliged 感激的; strung along 让…继续等待 to keep waiting
