[例1] 「B类」「French Revolution」

Which of the following, best describes the organization of the second paragraph?

(A). The thesis of the passage is stated and supporting evidence systematically presented.

(B). Two views regarding the thesis presented in the first paragraph are compared and contrasted.

(C). Evidence refuting the thesis presented in the first paragraph is systematically presented.

(D). The thesis presented in the first paragraph is systematically supported.

(E). The thesis presented in the first paragraph is further defined and a conclusion drawn.

解析:

第二段采用的是「总分结构」来进行说明, systematically表示总分结构, 可以首先确定ACD
C refuting表示反驳, 可以排除;

A 文章总论( _thesis of the passage_ )

D 段落总论( _thesis presented in the first paragraph_ ), 而第二段表明的是「二月革命」为什么没有文献而不是「所有成功革命」没有文献的原因, 所以这个是对的.
